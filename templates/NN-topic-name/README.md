- Avoid using other sites like stackoverflow.com for answers \-- part
  of the skill set you're building is finding answers straight from
  the source, AWS.

- Explore your curiosity. Try to understand why things work the way
  they do. Read more of the documentation than just what you need to
  find the answers.

## Lesson NN.1: Introduction to Topic Name

### Principle NN.1

*Write a single, short, memorable concept about the following lessons
here.*

### Practice NN.1

*Give an overview of how the following labs will reinforce the principle.
It shouldn't be more than a paragraph or two.*

*When writing labs for the principle, keep each one brief and tightly focused.
As the student moves through them, they should build knowledge once discrete
piece at a time. By the time they're done with all the labs for the principle,
they should have enough fullness in their understanding that they'll feel
confident knowing where to learn more, as well as knowing that they can
take on a project with the given technologies and learn what else they need
to know with reasonable efficiency.*

#### Lab NN.1.1: Exercise Title

*Each lab should illustrate one key aspect of the topic at hand.
Don't put too much in each lab, so that the code resulting from
a lab isn't burdensome for the mentor and student to review together.*

##### Question: Question Title

*At the end of each lab, consider asking 1 or more simple questions that
help reinforce the aspect of the principle that was just exercised.*

#### Lab NN.1.2: Exercise Title

...

##### Question: Another Question

...

#### Lab NN.1.3: Exercise Title

...

### Retrospective

*The retrospective is designed to create a conversation point for
further discussion between the mentor and mentee. The questions
here should provide good food for thought. They should challenge
the way the student solved the previous problems, seeking to ensure
they understand why they got the results they did. Consider asking
questions that play off common assumptions or call attention to
nuance in the solutions that might not have been obvious but is
valuable to know.*

#### Last Question

- *Link to AWS blogs and other relevant sources that encourage
  the reader to explore their curiousity.*
